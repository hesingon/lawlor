Email to JV (Heads of training)

Hi ______,
I hope you're doing well, I'm Darius and I'm from Street Smart University. We represent some of the top trainers in the world, including The Sales King; Aaron Sansoni, Chuck Mellon; who created Wealth Mastery with Tony Robbins, Henare and Kate O'Brien; New Zealand's #1 Transformational Coaches and Christopher Duncan, the world's most sought after growth hacking expert.
I'm writing to you to open up a discussion about providing relevant workshop opportunities for your subscriber, not to offend you, but 99% of agents today aren't marketing in the year we live in. What I mean by that is they're using old methods of lead generation and sales that worked 10 to 20 years ago. 
If you're anything like me, you hate receiving cold calls, hate getting cold approached by people on the street, you might even hate it when people try to ask you for a referral for their new business/insurance license.
The truth is, the prospects of the agency force are EXACTLY like that. We need new, better, more effective and more efficient methods to generate leads and close sales.
Are you available in the following week in the morning or afternoon to discuss how we can help the agency force elevate their performance?
Looking forward to your favourable response.

Darius He Xing
Street Smart University
